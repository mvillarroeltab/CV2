      <h2>Hi.</h2>
      <p style="line-height: 2;">I'm an architect / web developer based in London, UK. I have a passion for architectural design, web design and love to create for web and mobile devices.</p>

        <h3>Architecture Design</h3>
        <p class="description1">Currently working as an architect at the architecture and urban planning international practice Allies and Morrison in London
          where I have been involved in cutting edge projects such as the new BBC Studios at our budding Stratford East cultural hub
          where I am currently finalising Stage 4 and a new office development in Canada Water. <br>
          Previously I worked for four years at the Cambridge based architectural practise MCW Architects where I was involved as
          a fully qualified architect in several educational projects. <br>
          I have a keen interest in technological innovation to support the design process and is one of the reasons why I became one
          of the key people to implement the BIM system in MCW. This has given me an in-depth knowledge of Autodesk Revit. Outside
          of the office, I have been broadening my knowledge, trying out Dynamo and other software.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p class="description2">As a very design focused person I like to keep it simple. My goals are to focus on typography, content and conveying the message that you want to send.</p>
